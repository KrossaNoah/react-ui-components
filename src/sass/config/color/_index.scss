/// @color
/// Colors are organized into contexts, with the keyword @color-context
/// serving as their identifier.
///
/// * Each @color-context has a base state (with the exception of default),
/// a dark state, and finally a light state. The latter two will be
/// identified using the keyword @theme.
///
/// * Each state has the following properties:
/// 
///   - container - color for the base container background.
/// 
///   - on-container - color for text displayed on container.
/// 
///   - surface - background color for UI elements.
/// 
///   - on-surface - text color displayed on surface.
/// 
///   - alt-surface - alternative background color for UI elements (very useful
///     for dynamically changing the background based on certain user actions).
/// 
///   - on-alt-surface - text color displayed on alt-surface.
/// 
///   - accent - highlight color used for emphasizing elements.


/// Should merge all `@color-context` theme settings.
